# Disclaimer

The selection of newspapers for each country, as well as how the world map is drawn, currently only reflects the personal preferences of myself as the primary author of the code, and is not meant to be a prescriptive statement about how world events should be viewed. This applies to both the underlying perspectives behindthe newspapers, the languages of coverage, as well as perhaps other factors that I'm not even aware of. Furthermore, as much as this application's static content reflects my biases, it also represents my blind spots; there are certain selections that may be a certain way just because I haven't informed myself about the situation in the relevant area of the world. If you think this is the case then please do not hesitate to raise an issue in the repository, and if you think your disagreements with my preferences are untenable, please feel welcome to fork the code and use it as per the conditions set in the license (GPLv3).
